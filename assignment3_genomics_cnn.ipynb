The linked wikipedia article provides the information you need about the format of these files.  Your task is to extract sequences of length 500 centered at the location of each peak, which you will provide as input to the convolutional network you train.  \n",

This is available from the [Ensembl plants arabidopsis portal](https://plants.ensembl.org/Arabidopsis_thaliana/Info/Index).  In that page click on \"Download DNA sequence (FASTA)\", and the first five files provide the sequences for the five arabidopsis chromosomes.\n",

    "Your final data preparation task is to prepare a labeled dataset with positive examples that correspond to the peak sequences.  As negative examples, use random permutations of the positive examples.  Create one permutation from each positive example."
